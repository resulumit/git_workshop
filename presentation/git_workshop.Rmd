## Who am I?

Resul Umit

- post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo

- interested in representation, elections, and parliaments
    - [a recent publication](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1478929920967588):
    Parliamentary communication allowances do not increase electoral turnout or incumbentsâ€™ vote share

--

<br>

- teaching workshops also on

  - [writing reproducible research papers with R](https://resulumit.com/blog/rmd-workshop/)
  - [working with Twitter data in R](https://resulumit.com/syllabi/21spring_twtr.pdf)

## The Workshop &mdash; Overview

- Half a day, on how to 

  - version our academic work
  - store the different versions securely &mdash; in multiple places
  - collaborate with co-authors &mdash; in writing as well as versioning and storing

--

<br>

- Using Git and GitHub, through
   
  - command line tools
  - GitHub Desktop, RStudio
  
--

<br>

- Most useful for those working with pain text

   - e.g., Markdown, rather than Microsoft Word
   - but not exclusively so 
       - projects based on binary files would also benefit
       - you may switch to plain text in the future
        
---
## The Workshop &mdash; Motivation

- Research projects have many versions, as they are typically completed

  - over a long period of time
  - in numerous sittings
  - by multiple authors 
  - on multiple computers

--

<br>

- With many versions created over time, in different sittings ..., there emerges various challenges

   - keeping track of changes and versions
   - reverting to a previous version when necessary
   - storing versions safely in multiple locations
   - communicating the versions to other authors and/or computers
   - working on the same project with co-authors at the same time

--

<br>

- We all have to deal with these challenges on daily basis
   
   - efficient workflows can save precious resources
      - e.g., time, but also money and work itself from being wasted
   
---
## The Workshop &mdash; Worklow

- Using Git and GitHub 

   - originally designed for software development, but can be adopted to academic work
       - Git creates, saves, and tracks versions
           - can also save them elsewhere, such as on GitHub
       - Github keeps a copy online
           - allowing for safe storage, collaboration
  - might be daunting to beginners, but offers many benefits over alternatives
--

<br>

- Alternatives are easier to learn at the beginning, but sub-optimal in the long run

   - e.g., editing, renaming, saving, and emailing
   - e.g., using applications or websites such as Dropbox, Google Docs, Overleaf

]

---
## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation

- ~~Sit in groups of two~~

  - participants learn as much from their partner as from instructors
  - play the role of co-authors
  
--

<br>

- Type, rather than copy and paste, the code that you will find on these slides

  - typing is a part of the learning process
  - keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste does not work in the shell
  
--

<br>

- When you have a question

  - ~~ask your partner~~
  - ~~google together~~
  - if it cannot wait, turn your microphone on and ask
  - if it can wait, type it in the chat

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides<sup>*</sup>

Slides with this background colour indicate that your action is required, for

- setting the workshop up
    - e.g., downloading course material 
    
- completing the exercises
    - e.g., saving a different version of a file
    - there are 20+ exercises
    - these slides have countdown timers

## The Workshop &mdash; Organisation &mdash; Slides

- Codes and texts that go in .inline-c[appear as such &mdash; in a different font, on gray background]

--

<br>

- Results that come out in .out-t[appear as such &mdash; in the same font, on green background]
    
--

<br>
    
- Specific sections are .yellow-h[highlighted yellow as such] for emphasis
    
--

<br>

- The slides are designed for self-study as much as for the workshop
    - *accessible*, in substance and form, to go through on your own
    
---
## The Workshop &mdash; Aims

- To make you aware what is possible with Git and GitHub

  - we will cover a large breath of issues, not all of it is for long-term memory
      - one reason why the slides are designed for self study as well    
<br>
  - awareness of what is possible, `Google`, and perseverance are all we need

--

- To encourage you to convert into the Git and GitHub workflow 

  - practice with a mock project, co-author
  - start converting a real one right after the workshop
      - happy to help via emails afterwards

## Git &mdash; Download from the Internet and Install

- Git is a software that

   - keeps track of versions of a set of files
   - is *local* to you, the records are kept on your computer
   - is free

--

<br>

- To get this software

   - on Windows, install 'Git for Windows', downloading from [https://gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/)
       - select 'Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software'   
<br>
   - on Mac, install 'Git', downloading from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---
class: action

## GitHub &mdash; Open an Account

- GitHub is a hosting service, or a website, that

  - keeps a copy of the versions created by Git
  - is *remote* to you, like the Dropbox website
  - is, mostly, free
  
--

<br>

- To sign up for this service

   - register an account at [https://github.com](https://github.com/)
       - registering an account is free
       - usernames are public, editable
           - either choose an anonymous username for now
           - or choose one carefully &mdash; it becomes a part of users' online presence

---
class: action

## GitHub &mdash; Create a new GitHub repository

- Repository is a folder, or directory, which can keep files and other folders containing files under version control
    - a set of files whose records are kept together 
    - repo is a popular abbreviation for repository

--
name: create-github-repo

<br>

- To create a repo, on GitHub, follow:

> `Repositories -> New -> Repository name (e.g., "git_workshop") -> Public -> Create repository`

- observe that

    - repository URLs have the following structure: https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME
    
        - this is the address to view the repository online
        - for use in the `Terminal`, the address gets the `.git` extension
            - e.g., https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

--

<br>

Note that

   - `cd` is not a git command
       - it does not start with `git`    
<br>
   - you can drag and drop the directory onto the shell
       - instead of typing the full path

---

   - using the `cd` command
   - hint: after a space, drag and drop the folder onto the shell

<br> 

2) See the contents of the folder in the shell
   - using the `ls` command
    
`r countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `init`

Use the `git` `init` command to turn a directory into a git repository directory

```md
$ git init
```

.out-t[

Initialized empty Git .yellow-h[repository] in ../resul_git_workshop/.git/

]

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `init` &mdash; Notes

.pull-left-c[

The `git` `init` command creates a .yellow-h[hidden] `.git` subdirectory, with the structure on the right

- currently mostly empty
    - as nothing is being tracked yet

- not visible with `ls`
    - but visible with `ls` `-al`
    - on, on Windows, follow 
> `File Explorer -> View -> Hidden items`

- hidden, so that it is harder to delete or alter by mistake

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `add`  &mdash; Notes

- The `git` `add` command alone does not create a version
   - it must be followed by the `git` `commit` command, without which 
       - there is no version saved yet
       - the tracked files are said to be .yellow-h[staged], or in the .yellow-h[staging area]

--

<br>

- Use the `git` `add ` command (and then, the `git` `commit` command)
    - not only to add a new file to be versioned
    - but also, once that file changes, to snapshot a new version of that file every time
   
--

<br>

- A file in the staging area can be taken back, before its commit
   - by one of the following, depending on whether they have been versioned before

```md
$ git rm --cached README.md
```
   
```md
$ git rm --staged README.md
```

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `commit`

Use the `git` `commit` command to take a snaphot of, or to version, a repository

```md
$ git commit -m "adding the README file"
```

## Version Control &mdash; `git` `commit`

Use the `git` `commit` command to take a snaphot of, or to version, a repository
- with the changes in the staging area

```md
$ git commit -m `"adding the README file"`
```

<br>

Note that 
- committing requires .yellow-h[registering a message]
    - to yourself and to co-authors to indicate what has changed

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `commit`

Use the `git` `commit` command to take a snaphot of, or to version, a repository
- with the changes in the staging area

```md
$ git commit `-m` "adding the README file"
```

<br>

Note that 
- committing requires registering a message
    - to yourself and to co-authors to indicate what has changed
    - typed after the <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">&ndash;m</span> flag
    
--

<br>

Recall that
- committing requires one or more files in the staging area in the first place
   - staged with the `git` `add` command

## Exercises

3) Start tracking the README.md file
   - using the `git` `add` command

<br> 

4) Take a snapshot of the current version of the file
   - using the `git` `commit` command
    
`r countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `status`

Use the `git` `status` command to check the status of your repository
   - e.g., are there any untracked, modified, deleted, staged etc. files?

```md
$ git status
```

.out-t[

On branch master    

Untracked files:    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        data/    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        manuscript/    

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")    

]

---
class: action

## Exercises

5) Check the status of your repository
- using the `git` `status` command

<br>

6) Make a change to the `README.md` file, and save
- e.g., edit the first sentence on the list

<br>

7) Check the status of your repository again

<br>

8) Commit the new version
   - recall the combination of commands needed
    
`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = 30, top = 0)`

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `log`

Use the `git` `log` command to see the changes in reverse order

```md
$ git log

Note that

- commit hash is abbreviated to the first 7 digits, enough to uniquely identify each commit
    - i.e., 241b728 from 241b7285a00d47d69655d4a4afcd50989d5b50a8
- `HEAD` refers to the snapshot of your last commit
- `master` is the default branch name
    - we have only one branch at the moment, but can have multiple
    - think of a branch as a version of versions, or a copy of the whole repository

## Exercises

9) Make sure there is nothing to commit in the master branch
- using the `git` `status` command to see

10) Make a new branch and switch to it
- using the `git` `branch` and  `git` `checkout` commands

11) Start tracking the `data/journals.csv` file in this new branch

12) Commit the new version to this branch

13) Rename the first variable of the dataset, stage, and commit
- e.g., from `name` to `journal_name`
- both in `README.md` and `data/journals.csv`

14) Switch back to the master branch

15) Check the differences between the branches
- using the `git` `diff` command
    
`r countdown(minutes = 7, seconds = 30, top = 0)`

## Version Control &mdash; `git` `merge`

Use the `git` `merge` command to integrate different versions of your repository into a single version

```md
$ git merge `coding_branch`
```

<br>

Note that

- this line includes one argument
   - <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">from where</span> to merge

## Version Control &mdash; `git` `merge`

Use the `git` `merge` command to integrate different versions of your repository into a single version

```md
$ git merge `coding_branch`
```

<br>

Note that

- this line includes one argument
   - <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">from where</span> to merge      
<br>
- this merges into the current branch
    - move into the desired branch first
        - using the `git` `checkout` command

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `merge` &mdash; Conflicts

- Merge is done automatically if there are no conflicts
   - conflicts emerge when versions to be merged include edits *on the same line of the same file*
  - edits on different lines are not a problem as changes are tracked line by line    
   
--

<br>

- Merge conflicts require human intervention
   - by editing the conflicting lines
       - after the merge attempt
       - marked in the document with the conflict
   - and commiting the corrected file

## Version Control &mdash; `git` `remote` `add`


Use the `git` `remote` `add` command to define a different place, to save an backup of your repositories
   - e.g., a repository on GitHub
       - could also be a directory on an external hard drive


```md
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/resulumit/git_workshop.git 
```

---
## Version Control &mdash; `git` `remote` `add`


Use the `git` `remote` `add` command to define a different place, to save an external copy of your repositories
   - e.g., a repository on GitHub
       - could also be a directory on an external hard drive


```md
$ git remote add origin `https://github.com/resulumit/git_workshop.git` 
```

<br>

Note that this includes
- a valid .yellow-h[address for the external copy]
    - e.g., there is a repository on my GitHub account called `git_workshop`

# Part 4. What to Version

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## What to Version &mdash; Overview

There might be good reasons to exclude some others from versioning

- for local-only repositories

  - files that we (re-)create automatically as outputs
      - e.g., `paper.pdf`, as opposed to paper.Rmd
      
--

<br>

- for repositories that are also on GitHub

  - files that contain information that we do not want others to see
      - e.g., personal API keys    

    - files that we do not have the right to share with others
        - e.g., secondary data with user agreements otherwise    

    - files that are too large
        - individual files cannot be larger than 100MB

---
## What to Version &mdash; `.gitignore`

- `.gitignore` specifies which file(s) and/or folder(s) should be excluded from version control

  - is a file itself, to be saved in the root directory
  - allowing for us to use the .inline-c[git add .] shortcut

--

<br>

- `.gitignore` lists one item per line

  - each line has a pattern, which determines whether one or more files or folders are to be ignored

--

<br>

- See these

   - documentation at <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore> 
   - templates at <https://github.com/github/gitignore> 

---
## What to Version &mdash; `.gitignore` &mdash; Examples

.pull-left[

You can ignore, for example,

- <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">a specific folder</span>, relative to the root directory

]

.pull-right[

---
## What to Version &mdash; `.gitignore` &mdash; Notes

- There are many other pattern formats    

    - see the documentation at <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>

--

- Starting to ignore a file or folder that is already being tracked requires clearing the cache

  - after changing and saving `.gitignore`, enter the following line in the shell
  - with your speficic `/path/to/file`

```md
git rm --cached /path/to/file

```
--

- The following command clears *all* cache

  - might be useful after changes to `.gitignore` that involves several files or folders
  - but should be used with care, on an otherwise up-to-date repository  
    
```md
git rm -r --cached .

```

---
class: action

## Exercises

24) Create a `.gitignore` file on GitHub
- to ignore the paper.pdf file
- save and commit

25) Pull the changes to the local repository
- using the `git` `pull` command

26) Start tracking everything
- using the .inline-c[git add .]
- and commit

27) Push the canges to the remote repository
- observe the repository on GitHub to confirm `.gitignore` work as intended

# Part 5. Collaboration

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide).

]

---
## Collaboration &mdash; Project Setup

- The setup depends on the users' role, on whether they are
    - the *owner* who creates the GitHub repository, or
    - the *collaborator* who is then added to that repository

--

- Once the project is setup
    - it continues to be associated with the owner's GitHub profile
    - at the same time, it is listed under the collaborator's profile as well
    - both the owner and the collaborator have the same rights, unless otherwise restricted

---
## Collaboration &mdash; Project Setup &mdash; Owner

- The setup for the owner is largely the same as in any single-author, single-computer scenario
    - introduce version control to a local project with Git,
    - create a remote repository for that project on GitHub, and
    - associate the local project with the remote repository

--

<br>

- As an additional step, the owner needs to invite their collaborator(s) to the project
- following, from the relevant GitHub repository, 

> `Settings -> Manage access -> Invite a collaborator`


---
## Collaboration &mdash; Project Setup &mdash; Collaborator

- Notice that the remote part of the setup is done by the owner for the collaborator
   - subject to acceptance of the invitation
       - invitations are available directly at <https://github.com/notifications>, but also sent via email
       - on acceptance, projects appear among the repositories of the collaborator
        
--

<br>


-  The local part of the setup still needs to be done
   - by using the `git` `clone` command with the repository address
   
   
```md
$ git clone https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

---
class: action

## Exercises


28) Prepare for collaboration
- by assuming the role of first and second co-authors in your group


- Owners:
   - invite your activity party ion to collaborate
   - hint: you will need their username, full name, or email address to do so

- Collaborators:
   - accept the invitation from your co-author
   - clone the project to your a local repository
       - using the `git` `clone` command


`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

---
## Colloboration &mdash; Workflow

1) Pull

- on the Git tab in RStudio, click `Pull` to move the up-to-date records from GitHub to your computer
    - if your collaborator has not pushed anything since your last pull, you will be noticed that `Already up-to-date`.
    - collaborative projects require pulling as well as pushing because your collaborator(s) might have pushed their commits to GitHub
    - pulling frequently minimises the risk of merge conflicts

--

2) Edit and save; commit and push

- the same procedure as in any single-author, single-computer scenario
    - as described on [this slide](#git-github-basic-workflow) forward
- pushing frequently minimises the risk of merge conflicts

---
class: action

## Exercise

29) Non-simultaneous Collaboration

- take in turns with your partner to work on the same document (of the same project)
    - *owner*: edit the first header in the document (i.e., "R Markdown"), save, commit, and push
    - *owner and collaborator*: observe the changes, if any, on your own `.Rmd` file, and/or on your GitHub repository
        - click on the relevant commit message on GitHub and observe the commit
    - *collaborator*: pull, revert the header back to original, save, commit, and push

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

--

- notice that you have not encountered any errors and/or merge conflicts
    - because everyone edited and merged with an up-to-date document
    - this is the default scenario in single-author, multiple computer scenario

---
class: action

## Exercise

30) Simultaneous Collaboration &mdash; Different Lines

- work on the same document at the same time
    - *owners*: edit the first header in a document, save, commit, and push
    - *collaborators*: edit the second header in the document (i.e., "Including Plots"), save, commit, and push
        - observe the error message that the last pusher will receive, follow the instructions on RStudio to solve the problem

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

--

- notice that you have encountered an error but not a merge conflict
    - pulling before pushing solves the problem because the edits are not on the same line
    - the merge takes place automatically, on the *local* repository of the last pusher

---
class: action

## Exercise

31) Simultaneous Collaboration &mdash; Same Line

- work on the same document at the same time
    - *owners*: edit the first header in the document again, save, commit, and push
    - *collaborators*: edit the first header in the document as well, save, commit, and push
        - observe the error message that the last pusher will receive, follow the instructions on RStudio to solve the problem

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00, top = 0)`

--

- notice that you have encountered not only an error but also a merge conflict
    - pulling before pushing alone does not solve the problem because the edits are on the same line
        - the conflict cannot be solved automatically &mdash; it needs human intervention
        - by pulling first, you can view the conflict directly on the file
            - marked between less than <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">&lt;</span> and greater than <span style="background-color: #ffff88;">&gt;</span> signs, divided by the equal signs
            - solution is to accept the remote version, by deleting your edit and or moving that edit to a different line
    - merging takes place on the *local* repository of the last pusher

---
## Colloboration &mdash; Workflow &mdash; Alternative

- The workflow above is rather simple, but has some disadvantages, including
    - not easy, albeit still possible, to see the edits of the collaborators
    - not clear who is in charge of the overall progress
    - not possible to discuss edits
    - not possible to compromise on conflicting edits

--

- An alternative workflow exits
    - work on different branches of the same project
    - version control to your own branch
    - create pull requests with comments
    - merge the branch into master


---
## Colloboration &mdash; Workflow &mdash; Alternative

1) Branch
- using the `git` `branch` command to create a branch



2) Edit and save; commit and push
- the same procedure as in any single-author, single-computer scenario
- except that now pushing into a branch
- notice, on GitHub, that your commit is in the new branch, while *master* remains unchanged

3) Pull request

- On GitHub, click 
> `Pull requests -> New pull request`

- choose what is to be pulled, and write a note to your collaborator who can accept or reject the merge
    - if there are merge conflicts, the collaborator solves them on GitHub before merging

---
class: action

## Exercises

32) Pull request

- create a pull request for your collaboration project
    - create a branch for yourself
    - edit any line, save, commit, and push
    - request your branch to be merged
    
33) Merging

- view the pull request of your collaborator on GitHub
- merge it to *master*

## Applications &mdash; RStudio

Integrating RStudio into the workflow requires

1. .yellow-h[initial setup], done once<sup>*</sup>
    - unless for a new computer or, if ever, a new GitHub account
    - a bit technical, but worth the hassle
    
2. .yellow-h[project setup], repeated for every project
    - shorter, less complicated

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> We have started this process already, in Part 1 of the workshop, by downloading and installing Git and signing up for GitHub. [Back to the relevant slide](#install-git).

]

---
class: action

## Applications &mdash; RStudio &mdash; Inital Setup

1) Enable version control with RStudio

- from the RStudio menu, follow:

> `Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SNV -> Enable version control interface for RStudio projects`

- RStudio will likely find Git automatically. In case it cannot, Git is likely to be at

    - `c:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe` on Windows

    - `/usr/local/git/bin/git` on Mac

---
class: action

## Applications &mdash; RStudio &mdash; Inital Setup<sup>*</sup>

3) Introduce yourself to Git

- from the RStudio menu, follow:

> `Tools -> Terminal -> New Terminal`

- enter the following lines in the Terminal, with the email address that you have used to sign up for GitHub

```yaml
git config --global user.name "YOUR-NAME" 
git config --global user.email "YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS"
```

- enter the following line in the Terminal, to observe whether the previous step was successful

```yaml
git config --global --list

```

## Applications &mdash; RStudio &mdash; Project Setup<sup>*</sup>

1) Initiate local version control with Git

- from the RStudio menu, follow:

> `Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup... -> Version Control System -> Git`


- after confirming your new repository, and restarting the session, observe that 

   - now there is now a Git tab in RStudio, documenting the differences between you local repository and the one on GitHub. When you change a file, it will appear here.  
   
   - your project now includes a `.gitignore` file
       - this is where you can list files and/or folders to be excluded from being tracked

.footnote[

<sup>*</sup> These instructions presume there is an exiting RStudio project to be set up for version control. If not, or to start a new project.

## Applications &mdash; RStudio &mdash; Project Setup

2) Create a new GitHub repository

- on GitHub, follow:

> `Repositories -> New -> Repository name (e.g., "rwd_workshop") -> Public -> Create repository`

- observe that

    - repository URLs have the following structure: https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME
    
        - this is the address to view the repository online
        - for use in the `Terminal`, the address gets the `.git` extension
            - e.g., https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

## Applications &mdash; RStudio &mdash; Project Setup

3) Push an existing repository

- from the RStudio menu, follow:

> `Tools -> Terminal -> New Terminal`

- enter the following lines in the `Terminal`, with your username and repository name

```yaml
git remote add origin https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin master

```

--

- if this is your first time using GitHub with RStudio, you will be prompted to authenticate
   - follow the instructions on your screen and in your email

- observe that your project files are now online, listed on the GitHub repository
